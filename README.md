## data set

The dataset is individual loan data set provided by the  lending company Prosper. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. and i choose it as i was intrested in explooring the data provided by this company

## Summary of Findings

It is noticed that EmploymentStatus and StatedMonthlyIncome affect both of the main features (BorrowerAPR and ProsperScore)
People who are not employed receive low score and high interest rate compared to the employed
The higher the income, the higher the score and the lower the interest rate

It was observed that EmploymentStatus has a relation with ProsperRating where the un-employed are mostly given a High Risk rating

Number of Defaulted loans for Self-employed people are larger than those for Not Employed

Intersting to notice that Defaulted loans decreased after Q4-2008, also Current loans increased rapidly in 2013 (and it is logic that no Current loans before 2011 as the maximum loan term is 5 years)
